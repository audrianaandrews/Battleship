# Battleship

##Instructions: 
Objective: Sink your opponents ships.

The first board will show where you have attacked and if you
have hit any of your opponents ships.

The second board will show your ships and places where the
enemy has attacked. If they have hit one of your ships it will
show an 'H', if they have missed it will show and 'M'.

The board size and number and type of ships is the same for 
both players.

To attack your opponent you enter the row, followed by a space,
then column. Once all the ships of one player has been sunk,
then the winner will be announced and you will be asked if you
want to play again.
